# Install Notes for this ArchLinux ISO #
########################################

Thank you for using this ISO to install ArchLinux! Apart from the desktop environment provided,
this ISO uses the standard method to install ArchLinux. There are just a few addendums that
you should be aware of before proceeding with this installation.

Here is a link to the installation guide if you wish to browse it in Firefox rather
than the terminal: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide

Or, if you prefer, just open another terminal and call up 'Installation_guide'. A lynx browser
will open taking you directly to that page.


#
# User Privilages
#

By default, you are a normal user (named install) when logging into the desktop environment.
When using a command that requires root privilages (such as pacman), you will need to prepend 
"sudo" before being able to successfully execute. There is no password associated with the install
account, so don't worry about getting it wrong.

If you choose to install as root (like the normal ArchISO), just execute "sudo su", and proceed as normal.


#
# WiFi
#

Wifi is handled with the NetworkManager utility instead of IWD by default. If you have a wired connection,
check that you can ping an address; if that is successful, continue with the installation as normal. 
If you plan on using a wireless connection, hop into the terminal and run 'nmtui' to connect to the internet.
(Or you can use 'nmcli', although that's a little bit more verbose.)

If, of course, you desire to use IWD instead of NetworkManager, it is easily downloadable from pacman.


#
# Paru, a pacman wrapper
#

This ISO includes Paru, an alternative pacman wrapper, to allow for installation of packages from the
Arch User Repository (AUR). Be aware, however, that paru does not currently allow for pacstraping
packages to the installation disk, so you will need to download and build directly using the 'git clone'
utility (available from pacman by default).


#
# Disk Partitioning
#

While the install wiki recommends using 'fdisk' (a common partitioning tool), a slightly more user-friendly
utility to use would be 'cfdisk' (primarily for MBR disks/BIOS use) or 'cgdisk' (primarily for GPT disks/UEFI use).
If (and when) gparted begins working on Wayland successfully, it will be installed on the ISO, and we recommend
using it rather than a command-line utility (if you are new to installing.)


# 
# Extra Packages
#

If you're curious about what has been appended to this ISO, these are the most prominent ones:
	1) Window Manager
		a) wayland
		b) sway
		c) waybar
		d) bemenu (and bemenu-wayland)
		e) j4-dmenu-desktop
		f) dmenu
		g) alacritty (terminal emulator)
	2) xorg 
		a) xorg-server
		b) xorg-server-common
		c) xorg-xinit
		d) xorg-xwayland
		e) xorg-drivers
	3) firefox (web browser)
	4) networkmanager (internet connection utility)
	5) paru (a pacman wrapper)


And that's it! Thanks for using the ISO! Any questions should be directed to your local Department of Pedantry.
Hopefully this ISO is a little bit more user-friendly than just a black screen and a blinking cursor.
